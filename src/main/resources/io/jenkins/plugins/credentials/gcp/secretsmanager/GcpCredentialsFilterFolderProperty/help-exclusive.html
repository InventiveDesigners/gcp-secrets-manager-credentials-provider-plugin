  Normally filters are appended to the default server filter. By setting this flag you tell the system to ignore this server filter entirely for this folder.
  Use this to scope secrets to the folder without granting access to them in the more global default scope.
  In other words make sure the secrets no longer match the default filter but do match the folder filter.
